# JS-With-Babel
Simple Nodejs template with babel.

# How to Use?
Just put your code on `/src`. Then, you can use the following scripts:
- `start:dev`: Start in watch mode;
- `start`: Start the production server;
- `build`: Build the application;

When running `build`, a `dist` folder will be generated, with the minified production code.
